# Documentation of project_1_SQL

This repository contains data from my first project that I did during "WBS Coding School - Data Science" from 18th October 2021 to 11th February 2022

Contents of the repository:

- Publications - Contains SQL scripts with basic queries on the database publications and the database dump itself
- Magist - Contains an SQL script with queries on the database magist and the database dump itself

### Publications

I performed two SQL analysis about the publications database. The SQL scripts contain the tasks and the queries I wrote.

### Magist

This magist database originally comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). 
I explored the database and prepared a presentation in 2 1/2 days.

For this task I was a Data Analyst at a fictive spanish retailer who mainly sells Apple products and Apple compatible products.
Friendly customer support is key and here I step in, to tackle the following questions:
- Does magist serve as a good marketplace for high-end tech products?
- Can our company rely on a fast delivery of orders through magist for the Brazilian market?
